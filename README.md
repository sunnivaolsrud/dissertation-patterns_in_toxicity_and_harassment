# Dissertation: Patterns in Toxicity and Harassment in Online Discussion

INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION
---------------------------

The increase of harassment in online discussion has become a problem for several platforms; social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. This issue is also present on other platfroms such as Wikipedia and Yahoo, where editors and authors can coordinate work; and users discuss topics in different talk pages. 

in 2017 the Wikimedia Foundation in collaboration with Jigsaw wanted to analyse Wikipedia talk page discussion in context with personal attacks, toxicity, and aggression. This research, published as: Ex Machina: Personal Attacks Seen at Scale (https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08914), is the inspiration behind the Dissertation.
